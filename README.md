# 2048
I made this 2048 game in Unity game engine, using C#

# What is 2048?
Basically, 2048 is represented by a 4x4 grid. In the beginning of the game, there are two tiles on the grid, each displaying the number 2. Hitting the arrow keys on the keyboard moves the tiles around and creates a new tile in a random place with a random value of 2 or 4. When 2 tiles of the same value collide, they merge into one with the sum of these values. The goal is to reach a sum of 2048 in one of the tiles.
